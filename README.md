Design Patterns
    
The Repo contains four files.
    1. Builder Pattern
    2. Singelton Pattern
    3. Protoype Pattern
    
These files have examples of builder pattern, singleton pattern and prototype pattern implemented in java respectively.
These files can be used by placing them in the same direcotry as the code and including them using following
**    import Builder.Pizza;
    import Prototype.CloneFactory;
    import Prototype.FASTEmployees;
    import Singelton.President;**
    
There is a file named **NewMain.java** in this repo. This is the driver class to demonstrate the working of design patterns implemented.
This file can be used as a reference to use the examples of the design patterns implemented in the files explained above.
    
The files are coded in **Java 8.0**
There should be JDK installed in order to use the files.
